# PintoMSNPTest
SCRAPPED AND NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT!!!!

# What was this test about?
- This test was about figuring out for the future how to implement a basic MSNP server
- This was scrapped due to it wasting too much time

# Can I use this to make my own MSNP server?
- Yes, you can use this code for anything you want
- Just remember that by default (when you just download this from Github) it's not even near being completed
